Rooms at Hinxton Hall, the on-campus conference centre, have been put on hold and can be booked [here](https://www.hinxtonhall.org/accommodation/#how-to-book) with a pre-authorised code. Please email us at [biomics@bacpop.org](mailto:biomics@bacpop.org) to get this code after you have registered (payment will be required). Participants may alternatively book accommodation nearby or in Cambridge.
