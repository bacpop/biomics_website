The BIOMICS project is a Twinning initiative funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon programme. It is dedicated to supporting researchers, clinicians, and students by equipping them with advanced skills in data science through training programmes, staff exchanges, courses, and conferences.

This hackathon is open to anyone affiliated with one of the BIOMICS institutes. It will take place at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute [(EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)), located on the [Wellcome Genome Campus](https://www.wellcomegenomecampus.org/) [in Hinxton (Cambridgeshire), United Kingdom](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/52.07867/0.18460). Attendees from all institutes will work collaboratively on cutting-edge problems in biological data analysis. The hackathon will run for three days, from Monday 23rd to Wednesday 25th of February 2026.


#### Agenda
A detailed schedule will be made available closer to the dates of the hackathon.

Generally, the hackathon will consist of 4-5 sessions of group work, bookended by presentations about the problem being worked on.

We will also plan some social events during the hackathon, including a tour of the Wellcome Genome Campus, and a visit to a countryside inn.

#### Attendence Bursaries
There is some funding for partial or full attendence bursaries, but we cannot guarantee assistance to all applicants. 
Please select 'yes' during the submission of the forms, for both project submission and attendee registration.

### Accommodation
Rooms at the Wellcome Genome Campus conference centre have been put on hold and can be booked online with a code, which we can provide after registration (payment will be required). Participants may alternately book accommodation nearby or in Cambridge.
