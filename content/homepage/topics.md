The pathogen evolutionary biology community is getting closer to being
able to capture all molecular variation, and looking at it deeply both within single hosts and
across the entire population during transmission. To fully link the new scale of data with
sound evolutionary theory, we need strong collaborations between microbiologists,
evolutionary biologists, computational biologists, statisticians and mathematical modellers
and communicable disease controllers.

This meeting will bring the community together
to reflect on advances made during the pandemic, and how this will affect our future
research. Through a series of invited talks, we will explore the leading edge of pathogen
pangenome evolution, including:
- The use of metagenomics for pathogen surveillance.
- Analysis and interpretation of selection in pathogen populations
- The role of evolutionary analysis in emerging infectious diseases, spanning bacteria and viral species including
SARS-CoV-2
- New tools for evolutionary and pangenome analysis, including genome graphs.
- The union of evolutionary and epidemic modelling for inferring outbreak and epidemic dynamics.

This forum
will also allow for trainees and early-career investigators to learn from and
connect with many of the leading researchers in the field.

Understanding infectious disease pathogenesis and transmission through the lens of
evolution is a critical area of research.  One or two symposia would not be able to cover this breadth of topics, whereas the
additional time of a satellite meeting would allow these topics to be covered in sufficient
detail. We are delighted that SMBE have given support for this satellite meeting on
pangenome evolution.
